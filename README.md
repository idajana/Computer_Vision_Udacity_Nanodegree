# Computer Vision Udacity Nanodegree

The Computer Vision Nanodegree is broken into three parts:

1. Intro to Computer Vision - edge detection, semantic segmentation, object detection using traditional methods or by utilizing convolutional neural networks.

2. Advanced Computer Vision and Deep Learning - advanced methods such as YOLO, regin-based CNN, RNNs and combining them to create an Image captioning model.
3. Object Tracking and Localization - object motion and tracking, optical flow and feature matching, SLAM.
